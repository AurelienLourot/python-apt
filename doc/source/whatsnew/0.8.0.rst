What's New In python-apt 0.8
============================
Python-apt 0.8 is a new major release of the python bindings for the APT
package management libraries. It provides support for Python 3, new language
features and an API conforming to :PEP:`8`.

Despite the many changes made in python-apt 0.8, the release still provides
backwards compatibility to the 0.7 series. This makes it possible to run your
old applications. Applications using the old API should be updated to the new
API, because the old one will be removed after some time.

Support for Python 3
--------------------
Python-apt is the first Debian package to support the third major release of
Python. The port is straight forward and integrates as nicely in Python 3 as
the Python 2 builds integrate in Python 2.

Real classes in :mod:`apt_pkg`
------------------------------

Complete rename of functions, methods and attributes
-----------------------------------------------------

Supporting new language features like the :keyword:`with` statement
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Other changes
-------------
This release of python-apt also features several other, smaller changes:

    * Reduced memory usage by creating Package() objects in apt.Cache() only
      when needed.
    * Support to set the candidate version in :class:`apt.package.Package`
